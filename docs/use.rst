======================================================================
Usage
======================================================================

Given a :ref:`request configuration <request-config-file>` (e.g.
``MyS1ToS2.cfg`` in ``workingdir``), running S1Tiling is as simple as::

        cd workingdir
        S1Processor MyS1ToS2.cfg

The S1 products will be downloaded in :ref:`s1_images <paths.s1_images>`.

Temporary files will be produced in :ref:`tmp <paths.tmp>`.

The orthorectified tiles will be generated in :ref:`output <paths.output>`.


.. _request-config-file:

Request Configuration file
--------------------------

The request configuration file passed to ``S1Processor`` is in ``.ini`` format.
It is expected to contain the following entries.

You can use this :download:`this template
<../s1tiling/resources/S1Processor.cfg>`, as a starting point.

.. _paths:

``[PATHS]`` section
+++++++++++++++++++

.. list-table::
  :widths: auto
  :header-rows: 1
  :stub-columns: 1

  * - Option
    - Description

      .. _paths.s1_images:
  * - ``s1_images``
    - Where S1 images are downloaded thanks to `eodag
      <https://github.com/CS-SI/eodag>`_.
      |br|
      S1Tiling will automatically take care to keep at most 1000 products in
      that directory -- the 1000 last that have been downloaded.
      |br|
      This enables to cache downloaded S1 images in beteen runs.

      .. _paths.output:
  * - ``output``
    - Where products are generated.

      .. _paths.tmp:
  * - ``tmp``
    - Where intermediary files are stored.
      |br|
      As a S1 image may need to be used to produce several S2 tiles, once
      orthorectified, S1 images are cached in the tmp directory.

      .. note:: It's up to you, end-user, to clean that directory regularly.

      .. _paths.geoid_file:
  * - ``geoid_file``
    - Path to Geoid model.

      .. _paths.srtm:
  * - ``srtm``

.. _DataSource:

``[DataSource]`` section
++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. list-table::
  :widths: auto
  :header-rows: 1
  :stub-columns: 1

  * - Option
    - Description

      .. _DataSource.download:
  * - ``download``
    - If ``True``, activates the downloading from specified data provider for
      the ROI, otherwise only local S1 images already in :ref:`s1_images
      <paths.s1_images>` will be processed.

      .. _DataSource.eodagConfig:
  * - ``eodagConfig``
    - Designates where the eodag configuration file is expected to be found.
      |br|
      Default value: :file:`%(HOME)s/.config/eodag/eodag.yml`.

      From S1Tiling point of view, eodag configuration file will list the
      authentification credentials for the know providers and their respective
      priorities.
      |br|
      See `eodag ยง on How to configure authentication for available providers
      <https://eodag.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#how-to-configure-authentication-for-available-providers>`_

      For instance, given a PEPS account, :file:`$HOME/.config/eodag/eodag.yml` could
      contain

      .. code-block:: yaml

          peps:
              auth:
                  credentials:

      .. _DataSource.roi_by_tiles:
  * - ``roi_by_tiles``
    - The Region of Interest (ROI) for downloading is specified in roi_by_tiles
      which will contain a list of MGRS tiles. If ``ALL`` is specified, the
      software will download all images needed for the processing (see
      :ref:`Processing`)

      .. code-block:: ini

          roi_by_tiles : 33NWB

      .. _DataSource.polarisation:

  * - ``mode``
    - Running mode:

      - ``Normal``: prints normal, warning and errors on screen
      - ``debug``: also prints debug messages, and forces
        ``$OTB_LOGGER_LEVEL=DEBUG``
      - ``logging``: saves logs to files

      .. code-block:: ini

        mode : debug logging

      .. _Processing.nb_parallel_processes:
  * - ``nb_parallel_processes``
    - Number of processes to be running in parallel |br|
      This number defines the number of S1 images to be processed in parallel.

      .. note:: Must be <= to the number of cores on the machine.

.. _Filtering:

``[Filtering]`` section
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note:: The following options will eventually be used for the multitemporal
   filtering. They are not used by S1Tiling application.


.. list-table::
  :widths: auto
  :header-rows: 1
  :stub-columns: 1

  * - Option
    - Description

      .. _Filtering.filtering_activated:
  * - ``filtering_activated``
    - If ``True``, the multiImage filtering is activated after the tiling process

      .. _Filtering.reset_outcore:
  * - ``reset_outcore``
    - - If ``True``, the outcore of the multiImage filter is reset before
        filtering. It means that the outcore is recomputed from scratch with
        the new images only.
      - If ``False``, the outcore is updated with the new images. Then, the
        outcore integrates previous images and new images.

      .. _Filtering.window_radius:
  * - ``window_radius``
    - Sets the window radius for the spatial filtering. |br|
      Take care that it is a radius, i.e. radius=1 means the filter does an 3x3
      pixels averaging.


Log configuration
-----------------
Default logging configuration is provided in ``S1Tiling`` installing directory.

It can be overridden by dropping a file similar to
:download:`../s1tiling/logging.conf.yaml` in the same directory as the one
where the :ref:`request-config-file` is. The file is expected to follow
:py:mod:`logging configuration <logging.config>` file syntax.

.. warning::
   This software expects the specification of:

   - ``s1tiling``, ``s1tiling.OTB`` :py:class:`loggers <logging.Logger>`;
   - and ``file`` and ``important`` :py:class:`handlers <logging.Handler>`.

When :ref:`mode <Processing.mode>` contains ``logging``, we make sure that
``file`` and ``important`` :py:class:`handlers <logging.Handler>` are added to
the handlers of ``root`` and ``distributed.worker`` :py:class:`loggers
<logging.Logger>`. Note that this is the default configuration.

When :ref:`mode <Processing.mode>` contains ``debug`` the ``DEBUG`` logging
level is forced into ``root`` logger, and ``$OTB_LOGGER_LEVEL`` environment
variable is set to ``DEBUG``.

.. _clusters:

Working on clusters
-------------------

.. todo::

  By default S1Tiling works on single machines. Internally it relies on
  :py:class:`distributed.LocalCluster` a small adaptation would be required to
  work on a multi-nodes cluster.
