# Designates where the EODAG configuration file is expected to be found if not

# From S1Tiling point of view, EODAG configuration file will list the

# If True, activates the downloading from specified data provider for the ROI, otherwise only local S1 images will be processed.

# The Region of Interest (ROI) for downloading is specified in roi_by_tiles
# which will contain a list of MGRS tiles. If ALL is specified, the software
# will download all images needed for the processing (see [Processing] section)

# Must be "HH-HV" or "VV-VH"

[Filtering]
# If True, the multiImage filtering is activated after the tiling process

# If False, the outcore is updated with the new images. Then, the outcore integrates previous images and new images.

# Set the window radius for the spatial filtering
# Take care that it is a radius, i.e. radius=1 means the filter does an 3x3 pixels averaging.
